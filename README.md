# Unity Mobile Game Template

The Unity engine is a powerful tool for accelerating the mobile game development process, offering a range of templates, tools, and ready-made scripts that greatly assist game developers. These elements not only speed up development but also enhance user experience with performance-optimized and well-structured scripts. 

## Here are some key tools and systems included in this template that facilitate development:

The template consists of two scenes: Load and Game.

Load Scene:
In the Load scene, systems integrated into the template are initialized for use during gameplay. This includes essential systems such as the Pool System and Save System, which are prepared and configured to support seamless functionality within the game environment.

Game Scene:
The Game scene is where the core gameplay unfolds. This scene includes the loading of levels and the presence of main panels essential for gameplay interaction and progression.
